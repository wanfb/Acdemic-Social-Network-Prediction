# Task Review

## Task 1
Design clustering algorithms or community mining algorithms to cluster all the papers in the data set. Use visualize tools to show all fields (ie, communities, identify corresponding community research topics), and highlight the most influential scholars in each field.

## Task 2
Realization of demonstrating the ego-network to any input scholar (refer to the function example on the ArnetMiner website).

## Task 3
Use the data provided by DBLP and ArnetMiner to analyze and model more social relationships among scholars, such as predicting the cooperation or citation relationship between two scholars, and predicting which conference will a scholar publish papers on in the future.
