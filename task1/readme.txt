# Task 1
For Task 1, we use `Louvain` algorithm for community discovery. Louvain algorithm based on Modularity, which describes the closeness within communities. We reserve the communities that have more than 500 papers. The results can be seen as follows.

To use the code in task 1

#### 1. install requirements: 
* python-3.6;
* networkx-2.2;
* numpy-1.15.4;
* wordcloud-1.5.0;
* matplotlib-3.0.2;
* scipy-1.2.0;

#### 2. Run the following files in order:
* data_washing_to_dat-1;
* check_reference-2;
* relationship-3;
* pylouvain-4;
* community_analysis-5;
* author_analysi-6

#### 3. Result visualization
